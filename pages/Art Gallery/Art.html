         data-description="Cookie run is a series of gacha (overglorified gambling) games which I have been obsessed with for years. My favourite game out of any of them is 'Cookie Run Kingdom', because it:<br><br>- Is the most popular (meaning more frequent updates and community events).<br>- Has my favourite art direction out of any of the games.<br>- Is easier to understand all the mechanics of.<br>- Has my favourite characters. Most of my favourite characters are kingdom-exclusive and don't appear in other games.<br><br>Cookie Run Kingdom is one of my biggest artistic inspirations; the unique character and prop designs have always stood out to me, and are the main reason I'm still playing this game 3 years after downloading it. The many stories in this game are also incredible and interestign to read. I used to skip through the stories since I wanted to get back to the gameplay, but slowing down and reading what's going on has improved the experience an unreal amount for me.<br><br>Now, you might say gacha games are gambling and feed off gambling addicts in a way that only worsens them, and to that I say"
